## Chapter 1: What is Software Engineering
- Difference between Analysis/Synthesis
    - Analysis
        - Decompose a large problem into smaller, undestandable pieces
    - Synthesis
        - Build a software from smaller building blocks
- Difference between CS and Software Engineering
    - Computer Science
        - Focusing on computer hardware, compilers, operating systems, 
        and programming languages
    - Software Engineering
        - A discipline that uses computer and software technologies as a problem
        solving tools    
- "Not rocket science, folks"
- Fault vs. Failure
    - Fault
        - Occurs when a human makes a mistake, called an **error**, in performing
        some software activities
    - Failure
        - A departure from the system's required behavior
- Know the different views of quality (transcendental, user, etc.)
    - Transcendental view
        - Quality is something we can recognize but not define
    - User view
        - Quality is fitness for purpose
    - Manufacturing view
        - Quality is conformance to specification, a process view
    - Product view
        - Quality tied to inherent product characteristics, internal view
    - Value-based view
        - Quality depends on the amount the customers is willing to pay for it
- What is good software, three ways to consider quality
    - Quality of the product
    - Quality of the process that results from the software product
    - Quality of the product in the context of the business environment
    where it will be used
- Look at McCall's quality model *Probably not on it*
    - ![McCall's Quality Model](mccall.png)
- Quality of the process
    - Quality of the development and maintenance process **is as important**
    as the product quality

    - Finish one step at a time
    - Works well for problems with minimal/no requirement changes
    - Well understood problems
        - Able to break into sub problems and incremental steps easily
    - Easy to explain to customers
    - Hgih level view of the dev process
    - Know the drawbacks
        - Doesn't handle changes very easily
        - Views software development as manufacturing process
        - Software dev is a creation process
        - No guidance how to handle changes during dev
        - No iteration, because iteration best when problem is not understood well
        - Clients may not know the requirements        
            - They need to know them early in waterfall
        - Long wait before final product
    - Prototyping makes it more useful
    - No iterations in waterfall model
        - Usually in other models there are a lot of other iterations
    - Each major phase is marked by milestones and deliverables
    - ![Waterfall](waterfall.png)

    the right side is
    - Drawbacks of V
        - Similar drawbacks to Waterfall
        - Too simple, may not reflect software process accurately
        - Use of inefficient and ineffective testing techniques
        - Rigid link between left and right side

        - Too much time spent on prototype dev
            - Money
            - Increases involvement and attachment to prototype
    - ![Prototyping Model](protomodel.png)
- Phased development
    - Release first version, implement some requirements, then release part 2
    - Kind of like scrum
    - Incremental and iterative development
        - Difference between the two
        - Iterative
            - Starts with full system, then changes functionality of each
            subsystem with each new release
            - e.g. iPhone
        - Incremental
            - Start small and adds functionality with each new release
        - ![Incremental/Iterative](incit.png)
    - Shorter cycle time (time for requirements to delivery)
    - System delivered in pieces
        - Customers have something to use while the rest is being made
    - Two systems functioning in parallel
        - Production system (What's currently being used)
        - Development system (the next version)
    - Supported by US DoD, NASA
    - Desirable because...
        - Markets can be created early for functionality that has never been
        offered
        - Dev team can focus on different areas of expertise with different releases
            - Go from command line to point and click
        - Easier to test and debug because done in increments
        - Regression testing after each iteration
    - ![Phased Development](phasedmodel.png)
