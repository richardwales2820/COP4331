==================================

- Many good stories
- Has problems
- **A fault**
    - Occurs when a human makes a mistake
    - called **an error**, in performing some software activites
- **A failure**
    - a departure from the system's required behavior
- Error leads to fault leads to failure
- Examples
    - IRS lost $40.2 M on interests and $22.3 M in overtime wages
    - X-Ray machine, Therac-25 killed several people
        - Beam intensity increased due to errors
- Safety Critical
- **Transcendental view**
    - Quality is something we can recognize but not define
    - The software is easily maintained
- **User view**
    - Quality is fitness for purpose
    - System is as good as the user uses it
- **Manufacturing view**
    - Quality is conformance to specification, a process view
    - Create the right documents
    - Conform to the specification of the system
- **Product view**
    - Quality tied to inherent product characteristics, internal view

## 1.3 What is good software
- Good software engineering must always include a strategy for producing quality software
- Three ways to consider quality
    - The quality of the product
    - Quality of the process that results from the software product
    - Quality of the product in the context of the business environment where it will be used
- Users judge external characteristics
    - Correct functionality, number of failures, type of failures
- Designers and maintainers judge internal characteristics
- McCall's quality model
    - Study the model
- General -> Abstraction
    - Easier for software developers
- Quality of the development and maintenance process is as important as the product quality
- 80% of the budget spent on maintenance
- Development process needs to be modeled
- Models for process improvement
    - SEI's Capability Maturity Model (CMM)
    - ISO 9000
    - Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination (SPICE)
- Business value is as important as technical value
- Business value must be quantified
    - Businesses want to find what ADVANTAGE they get from a piece of software
- A common approach is ROI, return on investment
    - Interpreted in terms of:
        - Reducing costs
        - Predicting savings
        - Improving productivity
        - Costs (efforts and resources)

## 1.4 Who Does Software Engineering
- Customer
    - The company, organization, or person who pays for the software system
- Developer
    - The company, organization, or person building the software
- User
    - Person using the software
- Success increases when all three work together

## 1.5 System Approach
- Activities and objects
    - An acitivity is an event triggered by something
        - Update to payroll
        - Database cleanup
    - Objects or entities are the elements involved in the activities
- Relationships and the system boundaries
    - A relationship defines the interaction among entities and activities
    - System boundaries determine the origin of input and destination of output
- Respiratory system examples
- A computer system must also be clearly described
- Define boundaries with the customer
- A system is a collection of things
    - A set of entities
    - Activities
    - A description of relationship between among entities and acitivities
- Mission Creep
- Some systems are dependent on others
- A layered system
